My name is **Florian Rascoussier**, however I'm also known as **Onyr**, as my pen name.

I'm currently a PhD student in joint supervision between 2 french "Grandes Ecoles": IMT Atlantique and INSA Lyon, and spend most of my time in Lyon.

If you have landed here, it's maybe because you want to know a little more about myself. So I'm glad to embark you along a little tour of things I care about, as well as my personal information about my life in something less rigid than a classic CV. I have chosen to go down that path on 3 different axes: Science, Art and Philosophy.
