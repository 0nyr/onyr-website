*Selfies from my pilgrimage **#Lyon2Lourdes**, the first part of my journey to Saint-James of Compostela, in the middle of winter 2023.*

On March 14, 2023, after **25 days of travel** on the paths of Saint-James from the Fourvi√®re basilica overlooking the city of Lyon, I finally reached Lourdes! What joy and what a welcome!

This day remains etched in my memory. I thank Jean-Louis Doux for his kindness, his advice, and his prayers.

Today, nearly a year and a half later, this memory is still vivid. From now on, on some virtual paths of the Web, is a small beacon towards this resting place for travelers: [La Ruche Lourdes website](https://0nyr.github.io/la-ruche-lourdes/).
